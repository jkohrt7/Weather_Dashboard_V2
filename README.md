## Description
A front-end weather application powered by the OpenWeather API and TailwindCSS. This version has both technical and visual improvments: It is much more robust, accepting city/state/country parameters, and the appearance is more consistent between mobile and desktop versions.

## Installation
This repo exclusively contains the front-end javascript and CSS produced by Tailwind. Because of this, no installation is necessary; simply download the project and open the index.html file with a web browser or view it on Github Pages [here].

## Usage
This page is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://jkohrt7.github.io/Weather_Dashboard_V2/).

The search bar at the top accepts locations in the form "city", "city, state" or "city, country". Currently, only states in the US are supported.
The sub-header below the search bar is populated with previous searches. Clicking on these will launch a search with the stored parameters.
